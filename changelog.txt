Changelog

Adjustments
- Increased Forcefield Range to 100

Fixes
- Fixed script closing randomly
- Fixed a crash when using Forcefield
- Renamed some variables
- Improved performance
- Some other improvements and bug fixes

Notes
- To change Forcefield values for other players, you have to write "net" before "forcefield", otherwise it would overwrite the command to change the Forcefield values for yourself.
- To Explode a player once, you have to write "ss" (stands for SmileScript) before "explode", otherwise it would overwrite the Stand's default explode command.

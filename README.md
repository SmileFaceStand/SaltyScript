# SaltyScript
SmileScript is my main script, developed for Stand, using the Stand API. To join the Discord press [here](https://discord.gg/rejQB9jHQf).

## Is it already completed?
No, it isn't, not even nearly, now Iâ€™m introducing basic features that any script has, when it reaches version 1.0, it will mean that all the features I had thought of have been introduced. But this will not mean that it will stop having other functions added.

## How often will you update it?
Probably 1 major update every week or so. But mostly depends from my commitments and the size of the update.

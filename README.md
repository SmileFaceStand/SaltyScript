# SmileScript
SmileScript is my main script, developed for Stand, using the Stand API.

## Is it already completed?
No, it isn't, not even nearly, now Iâ€™m introducing basic features that any script has (My to do list is 6/58 done lol), when it reaches version 1.0, it will mean that all the features I had thought of have been introduced. But this will not mean that it will stop having other functions added.

## How often will you update it?
The first updates will be released very often, probably 1 update every 2 days, but then the updates will probably slow down.

## Where do i report a problem?
Describe the problem [here](https://github.com/SmileFaceStand/SmileScript/issues/new), and i'll soon as soon as possible.

# SmileScript
SmileScript is my main script, developed for Stand, using the Stand API. To join the Discord press [here](https://discord.gg/rejQB9jHQf).

## Is it already completed?
No, it isn't, not even nearly, now Iâ€™m introducing basic features that any script has, when it reaches version 1.0, it will mean that all the features I had thought of have been introduced. But this will not mean that it will stop having other functions added.

## How often will you update it?
The first updates will be released very often, probably 1 update every 2 days, but then the updates will probably slow down.

## Where do i report a problem?
Describe the problem on [Issues](https://github.com/SmileFaceStand/SmileScript/issues/new) or on [SmileScript Discord](https://discord.gg/rejQB9jHQf) and i'll answer as soon as possible.
